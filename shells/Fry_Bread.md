Fry Bread
===================

This isn't quite a tortilla; it's fluffier and a lot softer but it's really yummy and goes really well with taco meats and toppings.

Makes approx. 16 pieces

* 8 cups all-purpose flour
* About 3.5 cups warm water
* About 1 cup milk
* An additional 2 cups of Flour

1. Put all 8 cups of water into a large mixing bowl.
2. Slowly add water and milk into the bowl, mixing with (clean) hands until you get a sticky dough.
3. Let rise covered with a damp cloth/towel for at least 2 hours, but preferably all day.
4. Spread some of your additional flour on the counter and on a rolling pin.
5. Take a bit of your flour, about a half a palmful, and roll it into a ball. This will help to keep the rolled out dough round. Roll it out until you have a round thin piece of dough, maybe half a centimeter thick.
6. Pat on enough flour that it won't stick to anything and set on a clean plate to the side. Repeat for the rest of your dough.
7. When your all of your dough is rolled out, get a large skillet and fill with oil. Wait a few minutes for it to get hot. To test that it's hot enough, take just a smidge of dough and drop it in; the dough should start to bubble a bit and turn goldenish brown. 
8. Once the oil is hot, drop in one piece of dough. You have to do it this one at a time or else your dough won't cook. After your dough has been in there a few minutes and you see bubbles forming on the top, flip it over and leave it in long enough that it firms up a bit and is a goldenish brown color.
9. Repeat for all of your dough. If you don't wish for the air pockets, you can fry them without the oil in a skillet, but they might not change colors too drastically.
